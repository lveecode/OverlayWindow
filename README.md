## Overview

# OverlayWindow

OverlayWindow displays a new window on top of any existing ones. Perfect for controller-independent modal presentation. Fade-in animation for displaying and dismissing the overlay window

## Installation

OverlayWindow is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```

To generate an empty Podfile, navigate to your project folder and execute the following command:

```shell
$ pod init
